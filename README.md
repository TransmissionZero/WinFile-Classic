## Introduction

This is a fork of [Microsoft's Windows File Manager](https://github.com/Microsoft/winfile). It is an attempt to get the
application running on older versions of Windows such as Windows NT 3.x and Windows 9x.

For the time being, I'm looking to create a Windows NT 4 Unicode build with Visual C++ 4.2. If that proves successful,
I'll look towards Windows NT 3.1 and Windows 9x. If that works, who knows? Could it run under
[Win32s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32s)?

## History

The Windows File Manager was originally released with Windows 3.0 in the early 1990s. You can
